Imagine an e-commerce website, where you can add products to your cart. On top of adding items one by one, you can also
add bundles to your cart. For simplicity lets not have bundle pricing etc.

Therefore the system requires implementation of tree-like structure for items in your cart. Through the architecture
we can iterate through the items as if we are working with a tree.
