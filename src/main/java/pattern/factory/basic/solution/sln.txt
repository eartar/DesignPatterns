Solution lies in the Factory Design Pattern, where a factory class is created which is responsible for creation of objects dependent on the constructor that is called.

The client is expected to use the related factory method to create an object. OrderFood's constructor is also made private to prevent access.
If factory pattern is being implemented on an already existing code base which can't be changed, the parametric constructor can stay public.
However this is likely to create confusion among clients later. You should refactor alongside coding anyways!
