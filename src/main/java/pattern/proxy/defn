Proxy has a wrapper-like structure. It is similar to Decorator in a sense.

The main differences are
 - that proxy provides an identical interface, however decorator can provide functional extensions.
 - Proxy can be virtual, working on a un-initialized object

Proxy pattern is good for security and obscuring the actual service.
