In Singleton Pattern there should be one instance of the class object in your code. No code can create additional instances.

A method to achieve this is to make the constructor private, and have a getInstance method on the class.

However this creates the following problems:
1 - Serialization will actually copy your singleton - reading from file/stream etc where object -> Singleton cast is made
2 - Using reflection your class constructor can be made public

While (2) requires explicit invocation of reflection system, (1) can be achieved unknowingly.
