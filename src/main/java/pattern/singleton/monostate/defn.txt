Monostate singleton is a class that acts like a singleton. These are also called utility classes.

This is terrible for many reasons;
- No way of communicating the client that this is actually a singleton class
    - The constructor being public creates the illusion that multiple objects of this class can be created. But in reality all those objects refer to the same data.
- You are tightly coupling with the utility class!
    - Mocking tests are problematic: https://dzone.com/articles/static-methods-are-death-testa#
    - These statics are open to rotting. The source code for which they are created may or may not exist anymore. They have a tendency to accumulate over time.
