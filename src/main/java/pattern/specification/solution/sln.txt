we need a better solution, where every filter can be a standalone class-like structure
and a "middleman" class to apply the filters on the data

In other words;

This is called the Specification Pattern.

Lets separate specifications from the system into a package called specs.
Lets separate filters from the system into a package called filters.

We will use the a filter implementation of our choice to apply filters. In our case a filter interface
is unnecessary here, however we'll keep it in case we have additional house filter types in the future.
So we will be open for extension! - Remember O in solid.

To HouseFilterImpl we will attach a spec to do the filtering in our program.
