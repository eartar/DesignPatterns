We want every function of every builder function to return the inherited class in the hierarchy.
While this is not a problem for TeachingAssistantBuilder(the inherited class), the base class StudentBuilder can't
return a TeachingAssistantBuilder since it has no knowledge whether or not it is building a Student or a TeachingAssistant.

Therefore the StudentBuilder class should somehow be told the type of the object that is being built.

Using recursive generics(named template in other languages), we can make the Student builder;
(generics) get the a type "SELF"
(recursive) where "SELF" should extend from StudentBuilder itself

In other words, you have a generic, that is extending from(recursing on) itself(hence the complicated name).

The return types of every building function in the base class should also respect this SELF class
