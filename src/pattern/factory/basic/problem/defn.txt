Creating a food order online, you are asking the user to create and order using GetirYemek or YemekSepeti.
To order food, the user must enter their id and password and encryption operations should be done before connecting to the related servers.

GetirYemek uses RSA while YemekSepeti uses EAS for encryption.

However this is a terrible architecture, totally not in line with Open/Close principle.
